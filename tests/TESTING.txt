==CamScan Testing==

We split our testing at the module level, with each subcomponent responsible 
with ensuring its own internal consistency and especially correct results as 
returned to the caller for public methods. To this end most of the feature 
modules have automated unit tests. Some (such as the GUI) have to be tested 
manually; these tests are outlined below. In addition to the module level 
testing we've assembled a corpus of test data for integration testing which 
comprises documents and raw images for processing. This corpus can be found 
in the tests directory.
