Finally, we may have scared some of you today. CS32 is not meant to be a death march, and it will not be a death march.  A note on Labs: Assuming that all students have read the lab handout before coming to lab, our target is to have at least 50% of the students (if not 100%) complete the lab by the end of the 2 hour lab block. Many of the labs can be completed in under 2 hours.
