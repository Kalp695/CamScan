Foodler is holding a one-night contest w/ $100 prize, more details from JJ:

Foodler has a problem on holidays.  We know that many restaurants
change their hours (or close completely), but getting that information
from thousands of restaurants is difficult.

Today, we fax them a form to fill out with changes, and just close
down any restaurant that doesn't fill it out.  Of course, this is
error-prone.  Some restaurants don't get around to filling it out, so
we close them down in order to be conservative.  Further, it's labor
intensive, because our workers need to read and enter the new data
from blurry, handwritten faxes.

We'd like two tools to help us use the phone system to solve this
problem accurately, and with less labor. Twilio.com offers free developer 
testing accounts.


TOOL #1: Are you open?

This tool would be invoked a few minutes after a restaurant is
supposed to be open.  It would call the restaurant, identify itself,
and ask them to enter a code if they are open.  This just confirms
that a human is there, and they are actually open.  A command-line
tool like this:

 ./are-you-open 617-555-2121 367 0

 would fit the bill.  It would ask the person to enter 367 if they are
 open, or 0 if they are closed. Print

 "NO ANSWER" if there's no answer after, say, 8 rings.
 "BUSY" if there is a busy signal
 "OPEN" if the human types 367
 "CLOSED" if the human types 0
 "UNKNOWN" if the phone is answered, but no response is detected.
 "ERROR" for anything else - probably a twilio timeout or error.

 You can assume that we would do any retry logic, based on these
 responses.  No need for the tool to retry BUSY numbers, for example.

 TOOL #2: Are you closing?

 We would use this tool in lead up to a holiday.  It would call a
 number, identify itself, and find out the intended hours of the
 restaurant for the holiday in question.

 ./are-you-closing 617-555-2121 "Thanksgiving, November 25th"

 "NO ANSWER" if there's no answer after, say, 8 rings.
 "BUSY" if there is a busy signal
 "OPEN" if they confirm normal operating hours.
 "CLOSED" if they indicate they are closed entirely
 if the indicate different hours
 "UNKNOWN" if the phone is answered, but no response is detected.
 "ERROR" for anything else - probably a Twilio timeout or error.

 This tool requires you come up with the simplest way to enter hours
 that you can come up with.  The most common responses are normal
 hours, or closed, so you should probably just ask that first.  Then
 you might ask whether the are closing early. If yes, have them enter a
 time.  Then, opening late?  (I think Twilio can do voice synthesis of
 the text name of the holiday, otherwise assume we'll create an audio
 file.)

 We'll pay $100 for the best ./are-you-closing tool.  ($100 for the
 best ./are-you-open, if nobody gets ./are-you-closing done.)  The rule
 is: We get your code, and so do you.  We can do anything we want with
 it, as if we wrote it ourselves, but you lose no rights.  You can go do
 what you want with it too.

 Any stand-alone script/program is fine.  This is supposed to be a
 small hack project, so deadline is Friday at midnight.  Email code to
 jannotti@gmail.com. Although I can't be there, I should be able to
 answer questions by email during the night.
